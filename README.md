## Research Questions
1. Which were the top wine producing countries in year X?
2. Which are the current top wine producing countries in year Y?
3. What is the correlation between temperature and wine production?
4. What is the correlation between precipitation and wine production?
5. What is the optimal temperature for maximum production?
6. What is the optimal precipitation level for maximum wine production?
7. For which countries has the climate changed to favorably or unfavorably impact wine production?

Based on the above graph, our data shows the following:
- Wine Production Trend: There is a significant decreasing trend in wine production in France over the years.
- Temperature Trend: There is an increasing trend in the mean maximum temperature, but the relationship is not statistically significant.
