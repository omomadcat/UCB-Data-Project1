2. Which are the current top wine producing countries in year Y?
3. What is the correlation between temperature wine production?
4. What is the correlation between precipitation and wine production?
5. What is the optimal temperature for maximum production?
6. What is the optimal precipitation level for maximum wine production?
7. For which countries has the climate changed to favorably or unfavorabley impact wine production?
