DataType,Definition
DP10,Number of days with >= 0.1 inch
DP1X,Number of days with >= 1.00 inch
DT32,Number of days with maximum temperature <= 32 degrees Fahrenheit/0 degrees Celsius.
DX70,Number of days with maximum temperature >= 70 degrees Fahrenheit/21.1 degrees Celsius.
DX90,Number of days with maximum temperature >= 90 degrees Fahrenheit/32.2 degrees Celsius
EMNT,"Extreme minimum temperature for month. Lowest daily minimum temperature for the
month. Given in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on user specification."
EMXP,Highest daily total of precipitation in the month. Given in inches or millimeters depending on user specification.
EMXT,"Extreme maximum temperature for month. Highest daily maximum temperature for the
month. Given in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on user specification."
HTDD,"Heating Degree Days. Computed when daily average temperature is less than 65 degrees
Fahrenheit/18.3 degrees Celsius. HDD = 65(F)/18.3(C) - mean daily temperature. Each day is summed to
produce a monthly total. Given in Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees depending on user specification."
MNPN,"Monthly Mean Minimum Temperature of evaporation pan water. Given in Celsius or
Fahrenheit depending on user specification. Missing if more than 5 days within the month are missing or
flagged or if more than 3 consecutive values within the month are missing or flagged. DaysMissing: Flag
indicating number of days missing or flagged (from 1 to 5)."
MXPN,"Monthly Mean Maximum Temperature of evaporation pan water. Given in Celsius or
Fahrenheit depending on user specification. Missing if more than 5 days within the month are missing or
flagged or if more than 3 consecutive values within the month are missing or flagged. DaysMissing: Flag
indicating number of days missing or flagged (from 1 to 5)."
PRCP," Total Monthly Precipitation. Given in inches or millimeters depending on user
specification. Measurement Flags: T is used for trace amount, a is used for any accumulation within a
month that includes missing days. If no days are missing, no flag is used."
TAVG,"Average Monthly Temperature. Computed by adding the unrounded monthly
maximum and minimum temperatures and dividing by 2. Given in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on
user specification. Missing if more than 5 days within the month are missing or flagged or if more than 3
consecutive values within the month are missing or flagged. DaysMissing: Flag indicating number of days
missing or flagged (from 1 to 5)."
TMAX,"Monthly Maximum Temperature. Average of daily maximum temperature given in
Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on user specification. Missing if more than 5 days within the month are
missing or flagged or if more than 3 consecutive values within the month are missing or flagged.
DaysMissing: Flag indicating number of days missing or flagged (from 1 to 5)."
